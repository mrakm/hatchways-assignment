# About

## Frontend Assessment - Student Profiles
The goal of this assessment is to replicate the frontend application below as close as
possible. You are allowed to use any frontend framework (React.js, Vue.js, etc.) or use
plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We recommend using a frontend framework as the
later parts of the assessment will be very difficult without it.
If you notice something is not working (like the API, or any of the links in this document),
please contact hello@hatchways.io.
This assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
● Correctness: Is your solution complete and does it pass different test cases?
● Code Organization, Readability, & Maintainability: Is your code easy to read and
well organized?
● Code Performance: Is your code efficient? Did you use appropriate data
structures?
● Best Practices: Did you utilize good programming practices (write unit tests,
avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of
choice?
We use the following rubric to evaluate your submission. Please note that if your
submission does not attempt to complete all of the requirements, we will be unable to
provide feedback on it.
The assessment is broken into 5 parts to make it easier to complete.
You just need to submit one version with as much functionality as you can.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
